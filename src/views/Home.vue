        You like board games no matter the form? 
        You wish to meet new people while doing something fun?
        Perhaps you want to discover new games?
        Or youâ€™re looking for players to try out that brand new game you just bought or to play this old one you love?
    </p>

    <p>
        Whatever your reasons, welcome to International Board Gamers!
    </p>

    <p>
        This page is the meetup group for the International Board Gamers association in Gothenburg. 
        The purpose of the association is to meet new people and make friends, especially with people from various corners of the world. 
        We do this by organizing events related to board games and tabletop games.
    </p>

    <p>
        We organize gatherings once every week, alternatively on Fridays (18:00-22:00) and Sundays (15:30-20:00), to talk about board games in all their forms and of course to play the games we like!
        Any type is welcome: from those that only take 10 minutes to those that last several hours, co-operative and competitive, cards, strategy, hidden-role games, from those that are played with only two players to those that gather a whole crowd!
        These events are now free to join.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the language of this group is English, both online and during our meetings, to ensure people from every horizon can participate.
